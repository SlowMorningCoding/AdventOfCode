# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my collection of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions! This repository contains my yearly attempts at solving the Advent of Code programming challenges.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event featuring a series of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st through December 25th. Each puzzle typically has two parts that build on each other, requiring creative problem-solving and coding skills. For more information about the event, visit the [2025 event page](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about).

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by year, with each year containing solutions for the daily challenges:
