## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, this project now includes a `pyproject.toml` so you can install the package (and its dependencies) using modern tooling:

```bash
# install build tools (optional)
python -m pip install --upgrade build
# install in editable mode (recommended for development)
python -m pip install -e .
```

Note: `requirements.txt` is kept for simple `pip install -r` usage; `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621 + setuptools) is the canonical metadata for packaging.

### Running Solutions

Run all solutions:
```bash
python main.py
```

Run a specific day:
```bash
python main.py --day 1
```

## Solutions

- Day 1: [Not yet started]
- Day 2: [Not yet started]
- ... (Days 3-25)
